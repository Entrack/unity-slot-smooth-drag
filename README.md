This project contains some custom scripts that allow you to peform **smooth slot-docking dragging of the objects**.  
This is a complete demonstraion that **can be launched in Unity** (scene "Dry_drag"). I used some side libs to expand functionality (InputScripts for better touch registraion, SwiftShadows for graphical effects). 
**Folder GameScripts contains simple but effective classes I made** for this project. The demonstration shows:
* Object dragging
* Objects attracting back to the host if they were not placed in the right slot
* Smooth coroutine object transitions
* Object "lift-up" scaling
* Height-dependent shadows
